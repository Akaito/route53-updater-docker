# route53-updater-docker
Run this container to update a Route53 entry with your public IP address.  Think DuckDNS, but with Route53.

- If using locally, pay attention to the "credentials" and "Makefile" files.
- If using in unRaid, ignore those files.  The template will take everything in its variables.
